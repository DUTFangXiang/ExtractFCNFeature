% MCLEANUPREGIONS  Morphological clean up of small segments in an image of segmented regions
%
% Usage: [seg, Am] = mcleanupregions(seg, seRadius)
%
% Arguments: seg - A region segmented image, such as might be produced by a
%                  graph cut algorithm.  All pixels in each region are labeled
%                  by an integer.
%       seRadius - Structuring element radius.  This can be set to 0 in which
%                  case  the function will simply ensure all labeled regions
%                  are distinct and relabel them if necessary. 
%
% Returns:   seg - The updated segment image.
%             Am - Adjacency matrix of segments.  Am(i, j) indicates whether
%                  segments labeled i and j are connected/adjacent
%
% Typical application:
% If a graph cut or superpixel algorithm fails to converge stray segments
% can be left in the result.  This function tries to clean things up by:
% 1) Checking there is only one region for each segment label. If there is
%    more than one region they are given unique labels.
% 2) Eliminating regions below the structuring element size
%
% Note that regions labeled 0 are treated as a 'privileged' background region
% and is not processed/affected by the function.

%       se = strel('disk', seRadius, 4);  % Use approximated disk for speed
        mask = zeros(size(seg));

        else   % Rather than perform a morphological opening on every
               % individual region in sequence the following finds separate
               % lists of unconnected regions and performs openings on these.
               % Typically an image can be covered with only 5 or 6 lists of
               % unconnected regions.  Seems to be about 2X speed of option
               % 1. (I was hoping for more...)

    % 3) As some regions will have been relabled, possibly broken into several
    % parts, or absorbed into others and no longer exist we ensure all regions
    % are distinct again, and renumber the regions so that they sequentially
    % increase from 1.  We also need to reconstruct the adjacency matrix to
    % reflect the changed number of regions and their relabeling.
