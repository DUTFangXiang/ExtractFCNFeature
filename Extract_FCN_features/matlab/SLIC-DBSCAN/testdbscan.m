% TESTDBSCAN   Program to test/demonstrate the DBSCAN clustering algorithm
%
% Simple usage:             testdbscan;
%
% Full usage:   [C, ptsC] = testdbscan(E, minPts)
%       
% 
% Arguments:    
%         E - Distance threshold for clustering. Defaults to 0.3
%    minPts - Minimum number of points required to form a cluster. 
%             Defaults to 3 
%
% Returns:
%         C - Cell array of length Nc listing indices of points associated with
%             each cluster.
%      ptsC - Array of length Npts listing the cluster number associated with
%             each point.  If a point is denoted as noise (not enough nearby
%             elements to form a cluster) its cluster number is 0.

% DIGIPTS - digitise points in an image
%
% Function to digitise points in an image.  Points are digitised by clicking
% with the left mouse button.  Clicking any other button terminates the
% function.  Each location digitised is marked with a red '+'.
%
% Usage:  [u,v] = digipts
%
% where u and v are  nx1 arrays of x and y coordinate values digitised in
% the image.
%
% This function uses the cross-hair cursor provided by GINPUT.  This is
% much more useable than IMPIXEL

	    plot(u,v,'r+');
