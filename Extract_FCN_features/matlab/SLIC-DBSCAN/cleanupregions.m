% CLEANUPREGIONS   Cleans up small segments in an image of segmented regions
%
% Usage: [seg, Am] = cleanupregions(seg, areaThresh, connectivity)
%
% Arguments: seg - A region segmented image, such as might be produced by a
%                  graph cut algorithm.  All pixels in each region are labeled
%                  by an integer.
%     areaThresh - Regions below this area in pixels will be merged with an
%                  adjacent segment.  I find a value of about 1/20th of the
%                  expected mean segment area, or 1/1000th of the image area
%                  usually looks 'about right'.
%   connectivity - Specify 8 or 4 connectivity.  If not specified 8
%                  connectivity is assumed.
%
%  Note that regions with a label of 0 are ignored.  These are treated as
%  privileged 'background regions' and are untouched.  If you want these
%  regions to be considered you should assign a new positive label to these
%  areas using, say
%  >> L(L==0) = max(L(:)) + 1;
%
% Returns:   seg - The updated segment image.
%             Am - Adjacency matrix of segments.  Am(i, j) indicates whether
%                  segments labeled i and j are connected/adjacent
%
% Typical application:
% If a graph cut or superpixel algorithm fails to converge stray segments
% can be left in the result.  This function tries to clean things up by:
% 1) Checking there is only one region for each segment label. If there is more
%    than one region they are given unique labels.
% 2) Eliminating regions below a specified size and assigning them a label of an
%    adjacent region.
