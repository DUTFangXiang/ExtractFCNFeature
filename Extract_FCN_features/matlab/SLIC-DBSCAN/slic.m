% SLIC Simple Linear Iterative Clustering SuperPixels
%
% Implementation of Achanta, Shaji, Smith, Lucchi, Fua and Susstrunk's
% SLIC Superpixels
%
% Usage:   [l, Am, Sp, d] = slic(im, k, m, seRadius, colopt, mw)
%
% Arguments:  im - Image to be segmented.
%              k - Number of desired superpixels. Note that this is nominal
%                  the actual number of superpixels generated will generally
%                  be a bit larger, espiecially if parameter m is small.
%              m - Weighting factor between colour and spatial
%                  differences. Values from about 5 to 40 are useful.  Use a
%                  large value to enforce superpixels with more regular and
%                  smoother shapes. Try a value of 10 to start with.
%       seRadius - Regions morphologically smaller than this are merged with
%                  adjacent regions. Try a value of 1 or 1.5.  Use 0 to
%                  disable.
%         colopt - String 'mean' or 'median' indicating how the cluster
%                  colour centre should be computed. Defaults to 'mean'
%             mw - Optional median filtering window size.  Image compression
%                  can result in noticeable artifacts in the a*b* components
%                  of the image.  Median filtering can reduce this. mw can be
%                  a single value in which case the same median filtering is
%                  applied to each L* a* and b* components.  Alternatively it
%                  can be a 2-vector where mw(1) specifies the median
%                  filtering window to be applied to L* and mw(2) is the
%                  median filtering window to be applied to a* and b*.
%
% Returns:     l - Labeled image of superpixels. Labels range from 1 to k.
%             Am - Adjacency matrix of segments.  Am(i, j) indicates whether
%                  segments labeled i and j are connected/adjacent
%             Sp - Superpixel attribute structure array with fields:
%                   L  - Mean L* value
%                   a  - Mean a* value
%                   b  - Mean b* value
%                   r  - Mean row value
%                   c  - Mean column value
%                   stdL  - Standard deviation of L* 
%                   stda  - Standard deviation of a* 
%                   stdb  - Standard deviation of b* 
%                   N - Number of pixels
%                   edges - List of edge numbers that bound each
%                           superpixel. This field is allocated, but not set,
%                           by SLIC. Use SPEDGES for this.
%              d - Distance image giving the distance each pixel is from its
%                  associated superpixel centre.
%
% It is suggested that use of this function is followed by SPDBSCAN to perform a
% DBSCAN clustering of superpixels.  This results in a simple and fast
% segmentation of an image.
%
% Minor variations from the original algorithm as defined in Achanta et al's
% paper:
%
% - SuperPixel centres are initialised on a hexagonal grid rather than a square
%   one. This results in a segmentation that will be nominally 6-connected
%   which hopefully facilitates any subsequent post-processing that seeks to
%   merge superpixels.
% - Initial cluster positions are not shifted to point of lowest gradient
%   within a 3x3 neighbourhood because this will be rendered irrelevant the
%   first time cluster centres are updated.
