% MAKEREGIONSDISTINCT Ensures labeled segments are distinct
%
% Usage: [seg, maxlabel] = makeregionsdistinct(seg, connectivity)
%
% Arguments: seg - A region segmented image, such as might be produced by a
%                  superpixel or graph cut algorithm.  All pixels in each
%                  region are labeled by an integer.
%   connectivity - Optional parameter indicating whether 4 or 8 connectedness
%                  should be used.  Defaults to 4.
%
% Returns:   seg - A labeled image where all segments are distinct.
%       maxlabel - Maximum segment label number.
%
% Typical application: A graphcut or superpixel algorithm may terminate in a few
% cases with multiple regions that have the same label.  This function
% identifies these regions and assigns a unique label to them.
